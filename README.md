🌍 Empowering Insights with Power BI: Air Quality Dashboard 💡
I'm excited to showcase my latest project—a comprehensive Air Quality Report Dashboard created using Power BI! 🚀
📊 Dashboard Highlights:
Top & Least Polluted Cities: A quick glance at cities with the highest and lowest AQI (Air Quality Index).
Average Pollutant Levels: Key Insights into NO, CO, SO2, and PM2.5 levels.
Trends Over Time: Visual analysis of AQI trends from 2015 to 2020.
Geographical Mapping: An intuitive map view for region-wise air quality insights.
💡 Purpose of the Dashboard:
To bring clarity to air quality data and help stakeholders make informed decisions for a healthier and more sustainable future. 🌱
Take a look at the dashboard screenshot and let me know your thoughts! Would love to hear feedback and explore ways to further enhance data storytelling.
